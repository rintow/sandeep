                It is important to provide other means by which applicants can apply, either 
                throughout the process or at particular stages. This is a manual fail-safe, 
                which should be used to back up a barrier-free e-recruitment system.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be some people, both disabled and non-disabled, who simply cannot 
                apply online. Some cannot use computers (e.g. some people with light sensitive 
                epilepsy), some lack confidence in using computers, and others may find it 
                difficult to gain access to a computer due, for example to physically 
                inaccessible computer premises.

                Requirements for a manual fail-safe</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advertise the fail-safe on the website </strong>- Clearly communicate 
                    you have a manual channel. Emphasise that it is a fail-safe and is intended only 
                    for candidates who cannot use the mainstream channel, or who are unreasonably 
                    disadvantaged by doing so </li>
                <li><strong>Highlight the benefits to candidates of applying online </strong>(e.g. 
                    speed of response, ease of use, ability to track application etc.) while 
                    assuring them that if they cannot apply online they will not face discrimination
                </li>
                <li><strong>Provide person-to-person communications</strong> - Train and equip HR 
                    personnel and &#39;web-help&#39; team to communicate with people with disabilities (e.g. 
                    textphones, online instant message) </li>
                <li><strong>Keep candidates in the main-stream</strong> - Feed candidates back into 
                    the mainstream process as quickly as possible. The manual fail-safe should be 
                    used as a back-up to a barrier-free e-recruitment process, not as a replacement
                </li>
                <li><strong>Note: </strong>Automatically directing all candidates with disabilities 
                    to the manual channel is non-inclusive and reinforces negative assumptions and 
                    stigma </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                Speculative applications and job alerts</h4>
            <p>
                If you accept speculative applications or provide candidates with the option to 
                receive email or text alerts about future vacancies, ensure disabled people who 
                have applied offline also have access to this service. Employers who provide a 
                lesser service to someone for a reason related to their disability are at risk 
                of discriminating against an applicant.</p>
