                Adaptive (or assistive) technology enables disabled people to access computer 
                systems that would be inaccessible by conventional means.

                For example: <strong class="bluetext">Screen enlargers</strong> help people with 
                low vision. Also called screen magnifiers or large print programmes, they act 
                like a magnifying glass.

                <strong>On-screen keyboards</strong> are used by people who are unable to use a 
                standard keyboard. It lets the user select keys using methods such as a pointing 
                device, switch or Morse code input system.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Voice recognition systems</strong>, such as ScanSoft&#39;s Dragon Naturally 
                Speaking,assist people with mobility impairments allowing them to use their 
                voice instead of using a mouse or keyboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Alternative input devices</strong> enable individuals to control their 
                computers through means other than a standard keyboard or pointing device.
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples include smaller or larger keyboards, eye and head operated pointing 
                devices and sip-and-suck systems controlled by breathing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Screen readers</strong> are used for non-visual access to Window 
                applications and the Web. A screen reader allows users who are blind to hear 
                what is happening on their computer by converting the screen display to 
                digitised speech.
            </p>
            <p>
                Window-Eyes and JAWS are examples of screen readers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Refreshable Braille Displays </strong>are electronic devices that are 
                used to read text on a computer screen. Refreshable Braille displays only read 
                one line of text at a time made up of 20 to 80 cells.</p>
            <p>
                Each cell contains eight small pins, allowing eight-dot computer Braille to 
                dynamically represent what is on the computer screen
