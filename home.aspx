                Online-recruitment.com is an interactive demonstration of what your organisation 
                needs to do to achieve barrier-free e-recruitment for everyone. It has been 
                produced by the Employers&#39; Forum on Disability and with the support of the 
                London Development Agency.

                This unique website reflects the common features of careers pages used by both 
                private and public sector employers. While these features are drawn primarily 
                from UK websites, the principles of best practice e-recruitment are the same 
                around the world.

                E-recruitment, or online recruitment, is growing fast. Recent research estimates 
                that by 2011, 44% of recruitment spend in the UK will be allocated to 
                e-recruitment<sup>1</sup>. In 2009, 36% of internet users or an estimated 6.3 
                million people sought jobs online a 50% increase on 2008.<sup class="redtext">2</sup>

                E-recruitment systems can range from a simple website which includes information 
                on the company and current vacancies, to a more complex system that enables you 
                to apply online, make speculative applications and get job alerts, as well as 
                take online tests.
            </p>
            <p>
                E-recruitment can be convenient, fast and easy to use. It enables jobseekers to 
                find out about and apply for many more jobs. When done well it cuts costs and 
                simplifies the process for HR, recruitment and line managers.

                Yet, the processes which many companies use can exclude disabled people a key
